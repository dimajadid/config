It was free, it was fun, it was a little crass, and it was glorious. Enter Friday Night Funkin.",

At first glance, it seems to be a charming Flash-based rhythm game very reminiscent of Dance Dance Revolution: just press the arrow keys in time with the song. Though it retains a Flash game charm and aesthetic, Friday Night Funkin' does use a more advanced and modern framework. Designed and developed using the flexible and versatile OpenFL and Haxe, Friday Night Funkin' was a submission to Ludum Dare 47. The theme of that particular Ludum Dare was Stuck in a Loop. While Friday Night Funkin' didn't win any category, the team decided to continue to expand on the concept.",
